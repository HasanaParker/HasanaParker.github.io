# Project Description 🦄
![background](background.gif)
Everyone loves to listen to music. Music is a beautiful thing because like a story or a painting everyone walks away with a different intrepretation. I wonder though what would be the interpretation of a machine. The goal of this project is to give the neural network a song and having it tokenize the audio to text, then taking that text and geenrating a pixelated version of that image. 

## Project Goals
1. Transcribe Audio to Lyrics.
2. Randomly select lyrics. Generate image based off of the randomly selected lyrics.
3.  Pixelate that image
