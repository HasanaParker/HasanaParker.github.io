## Project Description :unicorn:
Everyone loves to listen to music. Music is a beautiful thing because like a story or a painting everyone walks away with a different intrepretation. I wonder though what would be the interpretation of a machine. The goal of this project is to give the neural network a song and having it tokenize the audio to text, then taking that text and geenrating a pixelated version of that image. 

## Project Goals
- [] Transcribe Audio to Lyrics.
- [] Randomly select lyrics. Generate image based off of the randomly selected lyrics.
- [] Pixelate that image
